# Senior-Design-Project

My Senior Design project from Spring 2021 where I made a handheld game console from scratch (coded in C for a PIC24 microprocessor)
Please see the included [FinalDesignReport.pdf](https://github.com/ericdigioia/Senior-Design-Project/blob/main/FinalDesignReport.pdf) for all technical and design information.
